![Logisim](/assets/graphics/logisim.png)

3 design homework assignments for EE M16/CS M51A. Logic gate level design of a 16-bit CPU. 
####Design HW 1
- Created a simple alarm program that buzzes when the input temperature is greater than the set point temperature

####Design HW 2
- Created a Datapath consisting of an Arithemtic Logic Unit (ALU) and a Register Bank

####Design HW 3
- Combined the Datapath from Design HW 2 together with a UI and Controller FSM to implement calculator functions
- Combined CPU with control FSM to create 12 operation infix notation calculator with memory
